TODO: RetirementPlan.io - Rails App
===================================

- Actually test delivered emails (not just that jobs get put onto queue)

- Checkbox in portfolio selection & simulation page (or in user profile?) that swaps between using implied return and historical mean return

- Allow options selection for efficient frontier calculation that sets max in one security at 90% (or XX%) instead of 100%
